 FEW THINGS ABOUT ME : --- My name is Misu Stefan and I'm currently first year , now passed the second year at University of Bucharest , Computers And Technology of Information


 --> PROJECT NAME: BOOKING HOTEL SYSTEM

 --> Personal project I have been working on.Something simple , not very complicated. 
     Made in object-oriented C++ programming.
 
 --> Few things about the project:

     >>>>>> things to ADD ( maybe in future) ----> To disconnect yourself from the account on 									timespan of 30 minutes
					     ----> Hotel recensions 

					     ----> ......

     >>>>>> Tried learning some c++ and I thought this project would get maybe to beginner to medium  
				level
     >>>>>> Used abstractization , templates , vector and map from STL , REGEX etc.

     >>>>>> Encountered problems at map , templates and regex. In the final, made them work.
  
     >>>>>> Left comments everywhere where I encountered a problem or for testing purposes.

     >>>>>> Tried to make a login system using files 
		
	--- > When you register yourself in the system your data gets written into the file. Then I 	used a map to link the id (which is unique) to the respective data of the customer.

	---> Same works the delete system (with the files) and the forgot password function too.
